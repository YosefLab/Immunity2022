Prerequisites:

Four files stored in <this_directory>/data

    - tpm.txt.gz: genes x cells TPM table
    - counts.txt.gz: genes x cells counts table
    - qc.txt.gz: cells x variable table of QC stats (e.g., Align%, N_Reads, etc)
    - meta.txt.gz: cells x variable table of experimental meta-data.  Columns are:
        - GFP: eGFP_pos or eGFP_neg
        - Stimulus: 12+21+23 or 1+6+23
        - Genotype: ctrl or KO


For each subdirectory, Th1_Pipeline and Th17_Pipeline, cd into the directory and run `snakemake all`

This performs processing but doesn't generate all figures.  To generate figure panels,
navigate Th1_Pipeline/scripts and run the python scripts from that directory. To generate the heatmaps
navigate to Figures/ and run plot_heatmaps.py
