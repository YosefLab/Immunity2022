# Steps to run analysis

## Setting up individual 10x lane data

Each subdirectory of individual represents a single 10x lane run.
First cellranger 2.0.2 was run to quantify expression/cell for each run on raw fastqs.
Then, a sym-link called `data` should be created in each subdirectory and should point to
the `outs` directory produced by cellranger.
Then, run `snakemake all` in each subdirectory of individual.

## Initial clustering of all cells to filter out non-donor CD4 cells

Navigate to combined_all_scvi and run `snakemake all`

## Processing of all cells after filtering

Navigate to combined_all_main and run `snakemake all`

## Processing of Colonic IEL cells CD4 T cells

Navigate to combined_Colon_IEL_main and run `snakemake all`

## Processing of Splenic CD4 T cells

Navigate to combined_Spleen_main and run `snakemake all`

## Processing of SI LPL CD4 T cells

Navigate to combined_SI_LPL_main and run `snakemake all`

## Processing of Colonic LPL CD4 T cells

Navigate to combined_Colon_LPL_main and run `snakemake all`

## Processing of combined Colon and SI LPL CD4 T cells

Navigate to combined_LPL and run `snakemake all`

## Target prioritization

After all other processing code has been run, navigate to Targets and run `snakemake all`

# Figures

After all processing code as been run, the python scripts in Figures can be run (run each
within its own directory) to generate relevant figure panels
