# Directory Listing

- individual: parsing/analysis of individual samples

- combined_all_scvi: Combine all with scvi.  Batch is Sample
    - Initial set of clustering for filtering out contaminant cells
    - This is where 'valid_barcodes' are derived from

- combined_all_main: Rerun of scVI on only the valid cells
    - Source of most of the analysis in Figure 2

- combined_*_main:  These directories combine with scvi and filter valid barcodes. Run on subsets of data
    - combined_SI_LPL_main
    - combined_Spleen_main
    - combined_Colon_IEL_main
    - combined_Colon_LPL_main

- combined_LPL: Colon + SI LPL.  Normalize Sample.
    We defined clusters based on this for downstream LPL anlaysis

Other directories for specific analyses
    - Gather_IL23r
    - Targets

# Prerequisites
## Setting up individual 10x lane data
Each subdirectory of individual represents a single 10x lane run.
First cellranger 2.0.2 was run to quantify expression/cell for each run on raw fastqs.
Then, a sym-link called `data` should be created in each subdirectory and should point to
the `outs` directory produced by cellranger.
Then, run `snakemake all` in each subdirectory of individual.
